    <p>In visual robot self-localization, graph-based scene representation and matching have recently attracted re- search interest as robust and discriminative methods for self- localization. Although effective, their computational and storage costs do not scale well to large-size environments. To alleviate this problem, we formulate self-localization as a graph classi- fication problem and attempt to use the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) as a graph classification engine. A straightforward approach is to use visual feature descriptors that are employed by state-of-the-art self-localization systems, directly as graph node features. However, their superior performance in the original self-localization system may not necessarily be replicated in GCN-based self-localization. To address this issue, we introduce a novel teacher-to-student knowledge-transfer scheme based on rank matching, in which the reciprocal-rank vector output by an off-the-shelf state-of- the-art teacher self-localization model is used as the dark knowl- edge to transfer. Experiments indicate that the proposed graph- convolutional self-localization network (GCLN) can signifi- cantly outperform state-of-the-art self-localization systems, as well as the teacher classifier. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/KojiTakeda00/Reciprocal rank KT GCN.</p>
