<p><b>Map Matching</b></p>
<p>
  Since 1995, we are particularly interested in map matching, the ability to match a local map built by a mobile
  robot to previously built maps, which is crucial in many robotic mapping, self-localization, and simultaneous
  localization and mapping (SLAM) applications. The goal of map matching is given a pair of input maps, to find a
  transformation (e.g., rotation, translation) from one map to the other. One of the most popular solutions to the map
  matching is RANSAC, in which a number of hypotheses of the transformation are generated from a minimal set of map
  features while each hypothesis is verified using the remaining features as a cue. Other solutions include information
  reduction with dimension reduction techniques. The map matching task is particularly important in the following
  contexts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Map updating. Change detection is an important task for updating maps in non-stationary environments. Map
    matching between a pair of environment maps generated at two different points in time provides cues for change
    detection. [* Hongbin Zha, Kanji Tanaka, Tsutomu Hasegawa, Detecting Changes in a Dynamic Environment for Updating
    its Maps by Using a Mobile Robot, Proc. IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 1997.]</li>
  
  <li>Map merging. Map matching is also an important tool for aligning multiple maps with different coverage and
    merging them into a global environment map. [* Kanji Tanaka, Eiji Kondo, Incremental RANSAC for online relocation
    in large dynamic environments, Proc. Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2006.]</li>

  <li>Map retrieval. Map matching is a standard building block of map retrieval. Map retrieval is usually an important
    first step of global robot self-localization with respect to an environment map. [* Kanji Tanaka, Tsutomu Hasegawa,
    Hongbin Zha, Eiji Kondo, Nobuhiro Okada, Mobile Robot Localization with an Incomplete Map in Non-Stationary
    Environments, Proc. Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2003.]</li>

  <li>Map compression. Map co-segmentation, the task of discovering map segments that commonly appear in multiple
    different maps, is important for unsupervised map compression and map segmentation. Map matching is an essential
    building block of map co-segmentation. [* Tomomi Nagasaka, Kanji Tanaka, Dictionary-based Map Compression for Sparse
    Feature Maps, Proc. Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2011.]</li>
