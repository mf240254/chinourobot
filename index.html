     Since 1995, we are particularly
interested in map matching, the ability to match a local map built by a mobile
robot to previously built maps, which is crucial in many robotic mapping,
self-localization, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
applications. The goal of map matching is given a pair of input maps, to find a
transformation (e.g., rotation, translation) from one map to the other. One of
most popular solutions to the map matching is RANSAC, in which a number of
hypotheses of the transformation are generated from a minimal set of map features
while each hypothesis is verified using the remained features as a cue. The
other solutions include information reduction with dimension reduction
techniques. The map matching task is particularly important in the following
contexts:

     Map updating. Change detection
is an important task for updating maps in non-stationary environments. Map
matching between a pair of environment maps generated at two different points
in time provide cues for change detection. [* Hongbin Zha, Kanji Tanaka,
Tsutomu Hasegawa, Detecting Changes in a Dynamic Environment for Updating its
Maps by Using a Mobile Robot, Proc. IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. Intelligent Robots and
Systems (IROS), 1997.]

     Map merging. Map matching is
also important tool for aligning multiple maps with different coverage and
merging them into a global environment map [* Kanji Tanaka, Eiji Kondo,
Incremental RANSAC for online relocation in large dynamic environments, Proc.
Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2006.]

     Map retrieval. Map matching is
a standard building block of map retrieval. Map retrieval is usually an
important first step of global robot self-localization with respect to an
environment map. [* Kanji Tanaka, Tsutomu Hasegawa, HongbinZha, Eiji Kondo,
Nobuhiro Okada, Mobile Robot Localization with an Incomplete Map in
Non-Stationary Environments, Proc. Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA),
2003.]

     Map compression. Map
co-segmentation, the task of discovering map segments that common appear in
multiple different maps, is important for unsupervised map compression and map
segmentation. Map matching is an essential building block of map
co-segmentation. [* Tomomi Nagasaka, Kanji Tanaka, Dictionary-based Map
Compression for Sparse Feature Maps, Proc. Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation
(ICRA), 2011.]
